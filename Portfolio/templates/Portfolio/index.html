        <h2>Hello.</h2>
           <div class="intro">
                 <p>Hi! I’m <strong>Dillon John</strong>, a passionate and dedicated Web Developer with a specialization in full-stack development, particularly using Python and Django. With a <strong>Bachelor of Technology in Computer Systems</strong> and professional certifications in <strong>IT Automation</strong> and as an <strong>AWS Certified Developer – Associate</strong>, I bring a solid foundation in programming, cloud architecture, and responsive web design.</p>

  <p>Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects ranging from e-commerce platforms to AI-driven SaaS solutions. Notably, I led the development of <strong>Ghostwriterv2</strong>, a generative AI-based platform utilizing Flask, Python, and Stripe API, where I showcased my ability to handle everything from backend logic to cloud deployment using Render. I also developed an e-commerce site, <strong>NXTPSP</strong>, where I integrated Stripe and Apple Pay, allowing users to purchase retro consoles while creating a seamless experience for both customers and admins with automated order tracking and email notifications.</p>

  <p>My freelance journey through platforms like <strong>Upwork</strong> has equipped me with the skills to work independently, delivering tailored solutions to clients, while ensuring punctuality and technical excellence. I enjoy collaborating with teams to solve real-world problems and focus on creating scalable, user-friendly applications that make an impact. I’m always excited to dive into new projects that push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.</p>

  <p>When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new tech stacks or contributing to open-source projects.</p>

  <p><strong>Let’s create something impactful together!</strong></p>
